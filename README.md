# GrenadeRun-EXILED2

## Features

An event where everyone starts out as Class-D Personnel, and fights to be the first to escape.
Grenades will be dropped on everyones head on a set interval, so it requires strategic timing of movement to avoid getting stuck with a grenade, while also avoiding the grenades of others.

At the end of the round, a leaderboard will be displayed for a configurable period of time before ending the round.

## Usage

Type `grun` during the lobby to enable grenade run for the following round.
